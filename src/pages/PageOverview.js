                    In the waning months of the Third Reich, the unpopular ten-year-old German boy, 
                    Johannes "Jojo" Betzler, can't wait to join the ranks of the Nazi Party's youth 
                    organisation, during an intense training weekend that guarantees to separate the men 
                    from the boys. Massively into swastikas and ready to give up his life for his megalomaniac 
                    idol, Adolf Hitler, instead, the FÃ¼hrer's tiny number one fan gets kicked out of 
                    the Hitler Youth after a disastrous first assignment in front of his peers--an ignominious 
                    defeat that earns Jojo an equally degrading nickname. Now, with nothing but time on his hands, 
                    Johannes is in for a rude awakening when he accidentally unearths his progressive mother's 
                    well-hidden secret and comes face-to-face with a shocking new reality so much different from the 
                    hypnotic indoctrinations he's absorbed. But, does everything happen for a reason? 
                    Are the others always the enemy? In a mad world, devoured by fear and prejudice, 
                    is youthful innocence humankind's redemption?
